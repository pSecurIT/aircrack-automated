# aircrack-automated

This script will try to capture the wep/wpa/wpa2-handshake of all nearby wireless networks and save them in a .cap file. Afterwards it will perform a dictionary attack on the captured handshakes. If the script successfully cracked the password of a wireless connection, it will try to login to that network.

Please use this script only if you are in a controlled environment and have permission of the owner of all surrounding wireless networks.
